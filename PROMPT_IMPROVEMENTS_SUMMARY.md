# Image Prompt Generation Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ❌ **Previous Problem: Limited Section Content**
**Before:** Only used first 500 characters of section content
```typescript
const sectionContent = section.substring(0, 500);  // Too limiting!
```

**After:** Uses FULL section content
```typescript
const sectionContent = section.trim();  // No limit - full section!
```

### 2. ❌ **Previous Problem: Only 2-3 Concepts Extracted**
**Before:** Limited to max 3 concepts from headers only
```typescript
concepts.slice(0, 3);  // Only 3 concepts
headerMatches.slice(0, 2);  // Only 2 headers
```

**After:** Extracts ALL concepts including:
- Main title
- ALL section headers (not just 2)
- First 3 key sentences from actual content
- Returns ALL concepts (no limit)

### 3. ❌ **Previous Problem: Poor Prompt Construction**
**Before:** Only combined 2 additional concepts
```typescript
const additionalConcepts = concepts.slice(1, 3).join(' and ');
// Only used concepts[1] and concepts[2]
```

**After:** Uses up to 5 additional concepts for richer prompts
```typescript
const supportingConcepts = concepts.slice(1, 6)  // Up to 5 concepts
  .filter(c => c.length < 100)  // Keep reasonable size
  .join(', ');
```

## How It Works Now

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Split Content by Headers** ✅
   ```typescript
   const sections = content.split(/^#{2,3}\s+/m);
   ```
   - Splits by `##` or `###` headers
   - Creates array of section contents
   - Logs: total sections, length, first line, Visual Aid presence

2. **Find Visual Aid Suggestions** ✅
   ```typescript
   findVisualAidSuggestions(sections)
   ```
   - Searches each section for Visual Aid patterns
   - Extracts: `text`, `sectionIndex`, `sectionContent` (FULL)
   - Logs: section index, Visual Aid text, section length

3. **Extract Concepts from FULL Section** ✅
   ```typescript
   extractKeyConceptsFromText(suggestion.sectionContent)
   ```
   Now extracts:
   - Main title
   - ALL section headers
   - First 3 sentences from actual text content
   - Returns ALL concepts (not limited)

4. **Create Rich Prompt** ✅
   ```typescript
   const allConcepts = [visualAidPrompt, ...sectionConcepts];
   createEducationalImagePrompt(allConcepts, 'introduction/details')
   ```
   - Visual Aid text as PRIMARY prompt
   - Up to 5 supporting concepts from section
   - Full context from section content

5. **Place at Correct Section** ✅
   ```typescript
   targetSection: suggestion.sectionIndex
   ```
   - Places image at exact section with Visual Aid
   - Detailed logging shows placement

## Example

### Input Section:
```markdown
## Cats Are Amazing Hunters

Cats have incredible hunting abilities. Their eyes can see in the dark, 
helping them spot prey at night. They have sharp claws that they use to 
catch mice and birds. Cats can also move very quietly, so animals don't 
hear them coming!

**Visual Aid Suggestion:** Picture of a cat stalking a mouse at night, 
showing its glowing eyes and extended claws
```

### Old System (Poor):
```
Concepts extracted: ["Cats Are Amazing Hunters"] (only 1!)
Prompt: "Cats Are Amazing Hunters, educational illustration, colorful"
```

### New System (Rich):
```
Concepts extracted: [
  "Cats Are Amazing Hunters",
  "Their eyes can see in the dark, helping them spot prey at night",
  "They have sharp claws that they use to catch mice and birds",
  "Cats can also move very quietly, so animals don't hear them coming"
]

Prompt: "Picture of a cat stalking a mouse at night, showing its glowing 
eyes and extended claws. Context: Their eyes can see in the dark, They 
have sharp claws that they use to catch mice and birds, Cats can also move 
very quietly. Educational illustration, colorful, simple and clear"
```

## Logging Improvements

### Section Analysis
```javascript
Content split into sections {
  totalSections: 9,
  sectionSummary: [
    { index: 0, length: 156, firstLine: "Introduction to Cats", hasVisualAid: false },
    { index: 1, length: 423, firstLine: "Hunting Abilities", hasVisualAid: true },
    { index: 2, length: 387, firstLine: "Jumping Skills", hasVisualAid: true },
    // ...
  ]
}
```

### Visual Aid Detection
```javascript
Found Visual Aid in section {
  sectionIndex: 1,
  visualAidText: "Picture of a cat stalking a mouse...",
  sectionLength: 423,  // FULL section, not 500 chars!
  sectionPreview: "Cats have incredible hunting abilities..."
}
```

### Prompt Creation
```javascript
Created prompt for image 1 {
  imageNumber: 1,
  visualAid: "Picture of a cat stalking a mouse...",
  sectionConceptsCount: 6,  // More concepts extracted!
  sectionConcepts: [
    "Cats Are Amazing Hunters",
    "Their eyes can see in the dark...",
    "They have sharp claws...",
    "Cats can also move very quietly...",
    // ...
  ],
  finalPrompt: "Picture of a cat... Context: eyes, claws, quiet...",
  targetSection: 1
}
```

### Image Placement
```javascript
Processing image 1/2 {
  imageNumber: 1,
  targetSectionIndex: 1,
  sectionTitles: [
    { index: 0, title: "Introduction to Cats" },
    { index: 1, title: "Hunting Abilities" },
    { index: 2, title: "Jumping Skills" },
    // ...
  ]
}

✓ Image 1 reference added successfully {
  placedInSection: 1,
  sectionTitle: "Hunting Abilities",
  hasImageReference: true
}
```

## Benefits

1. ✅ **Richer Prompts** - Uses entire section content, not just 500 chars
2. ✅ **More Context** - Extracts up to 5+ concepts from section
3. ✅ **Better Images** - Visual Aid + section content creates relevant images
4. ✅ **Correct Placement** - Images appear right after their sections
5. ✅ **Better Debugging** - Detailed logs show exactly what's happening

## Testing

Generate a lesson with 2 images and Visual Aid suggestions. Check the terminal logs:

```
Content split into sections { totalSections: 9, ... }
Found Visual Aid in section { sectionIndex: 1, sectionLength: 423, ... }
Found Visual Aid in section { sectionIndex: 3, sectionLength: 391, ... }
Created prompt for image 1 { sectionConceptsCount: 6, finalPrompt: "...", ... }
Created prompt for image 2 { sectionConceptsCount: 5, finalPrompt: "...", ... }
Processing image 1/2 { targetSectionIndex: 1, ... }
✓ Image 1 reference added successfully { placedInSection: 1, ... }
Processing image 2/2 { targetSectionIndex: 3, ... }
✓ Image 2 reference added successfully { placedInSection: 3, ... }
```

## Summary of Changes

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Section content used | 500 chars | FULL section (no limit) |
| Concepts extracted | 3 max (from headers only) | All headers + 3 sentences |
| Concepts in prompt | 2-3 | Up to 6 (Visual Aid + 5 concepts) |
| Logging | Minimal | Detailed at every step |
| Prompt quality | Poor (limited context) | Rich (full section context) |
| Image relevance | Low | High (Visual Aid + section) |
