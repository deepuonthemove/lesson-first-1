3. Select "Reading and Visual" learning style
4. Choose "1 Image" or "2 Images"
5. Click "Generate Lesson with AI"
6. Wait 15-45 seconds (models may need to "warm up" on first use)

## ‚ú® How to Use

### Generate Lesson with Images
1. Fill in lesson outline
2. Choose grade level
3. Select **"Reading and Visual"** 
4. **New dropdown appears** ‚Üí Select 1 or 2 images
5. Click "Generate Lesson with AI"

### What Happens
- Lesson text generated first (2-5 sec)
- Key concepts extracted automatically
- Images generated with FREE Stable Diffusion (10-30 sec)
- Uploaded to Supabase Storage
- Displayed in rendered lesson

**Note:** First image may take 20-30 seconds as models "warm up" (free tier). Subsequent images are faster!

---

## üéØ What You Get

### 1 Image
- Full-width display
- Generated from entire lesson content
- Prominently positioned

### 2 Images  
- First image: float-right (from first half)
- Second image: float-left (from second half)
- Content flows naturally around them

---

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### Images not generating?
```bash
# Check if API key is set
echo $HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY

# Verify in .env.local
cat .env.local | grep HUGGINGFACE
```

### "Bucket not found" error?
Create bucket manually (see Step 3 above)

### Images generate but don't show?
Make sure bucket is **PUBLIC** in Supabase Storage settings.

### Images taking a long time?
Free tier models may take 20-30 seconds to "warm up" on first request. This is normal! Check server logs to see progress.
