# Google Image API Update - gemini-2.5-flash-image

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Image Generation Model âœ…
**File:** `lib/llm/gemini-image.ts`

**Changed from:** Multiple fallback models (imagen-3.0-generate-001, gemini-2.0-flash-exp, gemini-pro-vision)  
**Changed to:** Single specific model: `gemini-2.5-flash-image`

**Why:** Google's image generation is now available through the `gemini-2.5-flash-image` model specifically designed for image generation via the Gemini API.

```typescript
// Now uses:
const modelName = 'gemini-2.5-flash-image';

const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
  model: modelName,
  contents: prompt,
});
```

### 2. Wait for Image Completion âœ…
**File:** `app/api/lessons/route.ts`

**Changed behavior:**
- **Before:** Images generated in background, lesson marked "generated" immediately
- **After:** System WAITS for all images to complete before marking lesson as "generated"

**Key changes:**
1. Images are generated and awaited
2. All uploads must complete successfully
3. If images fail, lesson is marked as "error" (not "generated")
4. TypeScript generation only happens AFTER images are ready
5. Lesson status set to "generated" ONLY when everything (text + images + TypeScript) is complete

```typescript
// Extract and wait for image generation
const generatedImages = await generateImagesInParallel(imagePrompts);

// Wait for all uploads
const imageUrls = await uploadImagesInParallel(uploadData, lessonId);

// Only mark as "generated" when everything is ready
await supabase.from("lessons").update({
  status: "generated", // Only when ALL content is ready
  // ... includes images, TypeScript, etc.
})
```

## How It Works Now

### Complete Flow

```
User Submits Form with "Reading + Visual" + 1 or 2 images
    â†“
API Creates Lesson (status: "generating")
    â†“
Generate Text Content with LLM (3-5 seconds)
    â†“
Extract Key Concepts from Content
    â†“
Create Image Prompts
    â†“
ðŸ”„ WAIT: Generate Images in Parallel (5-10 seconds)
    â†“ (if any fail, mark lesson as "error" and exit)
    â†“
ðŸ”„ WAIT: Upload All Images to Storage (1-2 seconds)
    â†“ (if any fail, mark lesson as "error" and exit)
    â†“
Add Images to lesson_structure
    â†“
Generate TypeScript Component
    â†“
âœ… Mark Lesson as "generated" (ALL content ready)
    â†“
User Can View Complete Lesson with Images
```

### Error Handling

**If image generation fails:**
- Lesson marked as status: "error"
- Text content saved for debugging
- TypeScript generation skipped
- User sees "error" status (not "generating" forever)
- Can retry by generating a new lesson

**If image upload fails:**
- Same as above - marked as "error"
- No partial completion
- Clear error logging

## API Requirements

### Google API Key
```bash
# Required in .env.local
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_ai_studio_key
```

### Model Access
- Model name: `gemini-2.5-flash-image`
- Available through Google AI Studio API
- Get API key: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey

## Testing

### What to Test

1. **1 Image Generation:**
   ```
   - Select "Reading and Visual"
   - Choose "1 Image"
   - Generate lesson
   - Wait for completion (10-15 seconds)
   - Verify status changes to "generated"
   - Verify image appears in lesson
   ```

2. **2 Images Generation:**
   ```
   - Select "Reading and Visual"
   - Choose "2 Images"
   - Generate lesson
   - Wait for completion (12-18 seconds)
   - Verify status changes to "generated"
   - Verify both images appear
   ```

3. **Error Handling:**
   ```
   - Temporarily remove GOOGLE_API_KEY
   - Try to generate with images
   - Verify lesson marked as "error" (not stuck on "generating")
   - Verify error message in logs
   ```

## Performance

### Expected Timing

| Step | Duration | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Text Generation | 3-5 sec | LLM generates content |
| Prompt Extraction | <1 sec | Extract key concepts |
| Image Generation (1) | 5-8 sec | Google API call |
| Image Generation (2) | 5-10 sec | Parallel generation |
| Image Upload (1) | 1-2 sec | To Supabase Storage |
| Image Upload (2) | 1-2 sec | Parallel upload |
| TypeScript Gen | 1-2 sec | Component generation |
| **Total (1 image)** | **10-15 sec** | Complete lesson ready |
| **Total (2 images)** | **12-18 sec** | Complete lesson ready |

## Logging

### Server Logs Show:

```
âœ“ Starting image generation - lesson will wait for completion
âœ“ Image prompts extracted
âœ“ Using image generation model: gemini-2.5-flash-image
âœ“ Image generated successfully
âœ“ Images generated successfully, uploading to storage
âœ“ All images uploaded successfully - lesson ready
âœ“ Successfully generated complete lesson
```

### On Error:

```
âœ— Image generation failed - expected 2 images, got 0
âœ— Image generation failed - lesson marked as error
```

## Benefits

### User Experience
- âœ… No partial content (images always complete)
- âœ… Clear status indication ("generating" vs "generated" vs "error")
- âœ… Can view lesson only when fully ready
- âœ… No broken image links or missing content

### System Reliability
- âœ… Atomic operations (all or nothing)
- âœ… Clear error states
- âœ… Easy debugging (check logs)
- âœ… Predictable behavior

### Developer Experience
- âœ… Simple model selection (single model)
- âœ… Clear logging at each step
- âœ… Proper error propagation
- âœ… Easy to test and verify

## Troubleshooting

### Images Not Generating?

1. **Check API key:**
   ```bash
   echo $GOOGLE_API_KEY
   ```

2. **Check model access:**
   - Ensure `gemini-2.5-flash-image` is available with your API key
   - Try generating an image at https://aistudio.google.com/generate-image

3. **Check logs:**
   ```
   Look for: "Using image generation model: gemini-2.5-flash-image"
   Look for errors after this line
   ```

### Lesson Stuck on "generating"?

This should NOT happen anymore. If it does:
1. Check server logs for errors
2. Check if background process crashed
3. Restart dev server

### Lesson Shows "error"?

1. Check server logs for specific error
2. Common causes:
   - API key missing/invalid
   - Model not accessible
   - Network timeout
   - Storage bucket issue
3. Fix issue and generate new lesson

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Users

No migration needed! Changes are backward compatible:
- Existing lessons (without images) work as before
- New lessons with images use new flow
- "Reading" style (no images) unchanged

### For Developers

If you've customized the image generation:
1. Update model name to `gemini-2.5-flash-image`
2. Ensure you're awaiting image generation
3. Handle errors properly (mark as "error", not "generated")

## Summary

**What changed:**
1. âœ… Using specific model: `gemini-2.5-flash-image`
2. âœ… Waiting for image completion before marking lesson as "generated"
3. âœ… Proper error handling (mark as "error" if images fail)

**Why:**
- Google's specific image generation model
- Better user experience (complete content only)
- Clear status indication
- Atomic operations

**Result:**
- Reliable image generation using official Google API
- No partial lessons
- Clear error states
- Better debugging
